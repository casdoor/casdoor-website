## Contributing

You can contribute to the documentation site in different ways: [Documentation Writing](#documentation-writing), [Translation](#translation), [Website Development](#website-development).

### Documentation Writing

For the configuration of the sidebar, you can refer to [Sidebar](https://docusaurus.io/docs/sidebar).

For the features that you may use when writing documents, please refer to [Markdown Features](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features).

A standard document should look like this:

````md
---
title: Title
description: description
keywords: [keyword1, keyword2]
authors: [GitHub username]
---

## Headers

Only h2 and h3 will be in the TOC by default, so h1 is not recommended to use.

### h3

#### h4

content

````

We use [markdownlint-cli](https://github.com/igorshubovych/markdownlint-cli) to lint the markdown and mdx files, you can use the following command to fix basic errors and get a list of document issues:

```bash
yarn lint:md
```

If you write docs using VSCode, Sublime, or Vim/Neovim, you can install the [extension](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint#related) to get better lint experience.

#### Caution

##### Admonitions

You can add [Admonitions](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/admonitions) in the documentation, but please leave two blank lines like this:

```md
:::info Title

Title is optional

:::
```

##### JSX

You can use JSX in documents, such as the [Tabs](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/tabs) component provided by Docusaurus, but to prevent Crowdin from breaking the code ([mdx-solutions](https://docusaurus.io/docs/i18n/crowdin#mdx-solutions)), please wrap the JSX code:

````md
```mdx-code-block
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
```

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="go" label="Go">
```

content

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">
```

content

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

````

### Translation

[Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/casdoor-website) and [Docusaurus i18n](https://docusaurus.io/docs/i18n/introduction) is used for Casdoor website's translation.

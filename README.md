# Overview

If you're here because you would like to contribute an edit or addition to the docs, you'll probably want to take a look at the `docs/` directory.

To edit the internals of how the site is built, you may want to get familiarized with how the site is built. The Casdoor website is a static site generated using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io). This directory is the frame of casdoor website. Visit the Docusaurus website to learn more about all the available configuration options.

## Directory structure

The following is a high-level overview of relevant files and folders. 

```

## Documentation sources

As mentioned above, the `docs/` folder contains the source files for all of the docs in the Casdoor website. In most cases, you will want to edit the files within this directory. If you're adding a new doc or you need to alter the order the docs appear in the sidebar, take a look at the `sidebars.js`. The sidebars file contains a list of document ids that should match those defined in the header metadata (aka frontmatter) of the docs markdown files.

## Website configuration

The main config file for the website can be found at `docusaurus.config.js`. This file tells Docusaurus [how to build the website](http://docusaurus.io/docs/en/site-config.html). Edits to this file are rarely necessary.

The `src/pages/` subdirectory contains the Casdoor components that make up the
non-documentation pages of the site, such as the homepage.

## Contributing

### Create a branch

1.  `git checkout master` from any folder in your local `casdoor-website` repository.
1.  `git pull origin master` to ensure you have the latest main code.
1.  `git checkout -b the-name-of-my-branch` (replacing `the-name-of-my-branch`
    with a suitable name) to create a branch.

### Make the change

1.  Follow the [Running locally](#running-locally) instructions.
1.  Save the files and check in the browser. Some changes may require a server restart.

### Test the change

If possible, test any visual changes in all latest versions of common browsers, on both desktop and mobile.

### Push it

1.  Run `yarn prettier` to ensure your changes are consistent with other files in
    the repo
1.  `git add -A && git commit -m "My message"` (replacing `My message` with a
    commit message, such as `Fixed header logo on Android`) to stage and commit
    your changes
1.  `git push my-fork-name the-name-of-my-branch`
1.  Go to the [casdoor-website repo](https://github.com/casdoor/casdoor-website) and you should see recently pushed branches.

The **Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)** is a Linux Foundation project that promotes cloud-native technologies. Its vision is to make cloud native ubiquitous. CNCF maintains the **Cloud Native Landscape** ([https://landscape.cncf.io](https://landscape.cncf.io)), which classifies and tracks projects and products in the cloud-native ecosystem and serves as a reference map for developers and enterprises.

## Looking ahead

Joining the CNCF Landscape reflects progress in Casdoor’s maturity and community. We will keep improving Casdoor and its integration with cloud-native workflows, and we welcome more users and contributors to join the community.

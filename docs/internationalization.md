Casdoor supports multi-languages. By deploying the translations to [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/casdoor-web), we support Chinese, French, German, Russian, Japanese and Korean.

Casdoor uses the official Crowdin cli to sync translations from Crowdin. If you want to add more languages supports, please propose in [our community](https://github.com/casdoor/casdoor), and if you want to help us speed up the translating work, please help us translate on [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/casdoor-web).

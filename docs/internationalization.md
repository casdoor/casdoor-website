Casdoor provides native interface translations for users worldwide. The platform currently maintains translations in eleven languages: English, Spanish, French, German, Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese, Portuguese, Turkish, Polish, and Ukrainian. These translations cover both the frontend user interface and backend messaging, ensuring a consistent experience regardless of your preferred language.

Translation work happens through [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/casdoor-web), where the community helps keep each language accurate and up-to-date. When you configure Casdoor, you'll find these languages available in dropdowns throughout the system - from user profiles to organization settings. The platform automatically syncs translations using Crowdin's CLI, pulling in the latest improvements contributed by translators.

The current language selection reflects a balance between coverage and maintainability. Each supported language has active translators who ensure quality remains high. If you'd like to help improve translations for any of these languages, you can contribute directly on [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/casdoor-web). Translation contributions help users in your region have a better experience with Casdoor.

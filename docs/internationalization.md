Casdoor’s interface and backend messages are translated into multiple languages. Supported languages include: English, Spanish, French, German, Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese, Portuguese, Turkish, Polish, and Ukrainian. The same set of languages is available across the product (e.g. user profiles, organization settings) for a consistent experience.

Translations are managed on [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/casdoor-web). The project syncs with Crowdin so that community contributions are pulled in and kept up to date.

If you want to improve or add translations, contribute on [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/casdoor-web). Your contributions help users in your language use Casdoor more effectively.

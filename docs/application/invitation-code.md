## Introduction
If you want to restrict the application sign up, you can use the invitation code. The invitation code is a string that 
can be used to sign up for the application. It is generated by the administrator and can be used multiple times. An application
can have multiple invitation codes.

## Config
1. First, add the signup item `Invitation code` in the signup item table.
2. Then, add the invitation code in the application config page.

:::tip
Once the application has invitation codes, the user can only sign up for the application with one invitation code. No
matter whether the signup item `Invitation code` is visible or not, the user must fill in the invitation code to sign up for the application.
So if you want to use the invitation code, you need to add the signup item `Invitation code` in the signup item table.

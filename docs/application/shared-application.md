## Introduction

If you want to create an application that can be shared with other organizations, you can enable Is Shared field in applicaion(for safety reason, only built-in organization can create shared application). To specified the organiztion, you should add `-org-` and organization name after clientId / application name. For example, the clientId of application is `2dc94ccbec09612c04ac`, your organization name is `casbin`, the clientId for your organization is `2dc94ccbec09612c04ac-org-casbin` and the login url for oauth is `https://door.casdoor.com/login/oauth/authorize?client_id=2dc94ccbec09612c04ac-org-casbin&response_type=code&redirect_uri=http://localhost:9000&scope=read&state=casdoor`.

## Configuration

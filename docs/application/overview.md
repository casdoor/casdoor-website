Every application in Casdoor is called an `application`, and they are not related and do not affect each other, which means you can deploy or stop any application separately, as long as you like.

If you want to use Casdoor to provide login service for your web Web APPs, you can add them as Casdoor applications.

Users can access all applications in their organizations without login twice.

The application configuration is very flexible and simple. You can set whether to allow password login or third-party login, configure the third-party applications you want users to log in, and you can even customize the signup items of the application, etc. 

In this chapter you will learn how to start an application of your own, everything from scratch.

Let's explore together!

To set up Okta OIDC provider, first visit [Okta Developer](https://developer.okta.com/signup/) and sign up to get a developer account.

Navigate to **Applications > Applications** tab, click **Create App Integration**, select a **Sign-in method** of **OIDC - OpenID Connect**, and select an **Application type** of **Web Application**, then click **Next**.

Enter the **Sign-in redirect URIs** , such as `https://door.casdoor.com/callback`.

In the **Assignments** section, define the type of **Controlled access** for your app, then click **Save** to create the app integration.

Now you get `Client ID`, `Client secret`, and `Okta domain`.

Add a Okta OAuth provider in Casdoor dashboard, enter your `Client ID`, `Client secret`, and `Domain`.

:::info Set domain correctly

Note that `Domain` is not just `Okta domain`, `/oauth2/default` should be appended to it.

Visit [Okta docs on authorization servers](https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/auth-servers/) to get more details.

Now you can use Okta as third party service to complete authentication.

To set up Linkedin OAuth provider, please go to [Linkedin developer](https://www.linkedin.com/developers/apps/new) to create a new app.

After filling in the form above and creating your app, you'll need to verify the Linkedin page associated with the app

:::note

Only the company page administrator can verify your app, and give permission to your app

:::

After your app is verified, you can continue:

![Linkedin signin](/img/providers/OAuth/linkedinsignin.png)

Add Authorized redirect URLs for your app as **your Casdoor callback URL**.

:::info Set authorized redirect URLs correctly

In Linkedin OAuth config, the `authorized redirect URLs` must be **your Casdoor's callback url**, and the `Redirect URL` in Casdoor should be **your application callback url**

For more details, please read [App config](/docs/application/config#further-understanding)

:::

Then you can obtain your ```Client ID``` and ```Client Secret```

Add a Linkedin OAuth provider and fill the ```Client ID``` and ```Client Secret``` in your Casdoor.

Now you can use Linkedin as third party service to complete authentication!

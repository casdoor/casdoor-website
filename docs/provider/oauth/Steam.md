## Steam ✔️

Visit [Steam WebAPI platform](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/revokekey) and log in using your Steam account, then apply for an API Key for your casdoor domain or ip, and finally fill in your API Key as Client Secret into Casdoor. (ClientID does not need to be filled, and your steam  account needs to have games to apply for the API)

For more detailed information, please visit [Steam WebAPI doc](https://steamcommunity.com/dev).

##  Twitter(still workingðŸš§)

> Twitterâ€™s application steps are somewhat troublesome, and the official restrictions are a bit strict, so it may be more difficult to apply for a developer account than other third-party platforms.

Visit [Developer Portal](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard), register if you don't have an account. Twitter needs to know what you are applying for a developer account for. You must fill in it carefully, otherwise it will not pass.

After the application is approved, create an application, fill in the callback address and other information, you need to do two things, which will be set is **Authentication settings** section.

- Manually turn on **3-legged OAuth**, for Sign in with Twitter, posting Tweets on behalf of other accounts and more.
- Enable **Request email address from users**, for getting user email address.

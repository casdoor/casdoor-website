This is an example of **Azure Blob**

:::

- You must have an [Azure storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-account-create?tabs=azure-portal) account.

### Step1. Select Azure Blob

Select the Azure Blob as the storage type. ![azureSelect.png](/img/providers/storage/azureSelect.png)

### Step2. Fill the necessary information in Casdoor

There are four required fields. `Client ID`, `Client secret`, `Endpoint`, `Bucket`. The relationship corresponding to the Azure Blob account is as follows:

| Name                | Name in Azure   | is required |
|---------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Client ID           | AccountName     | required    |
| Client secret       | AccountKey      | required    |
| Endpoint            | ContainerUrl    | required    |
| Endpoint (intranet) | PrivateEndpoint |             |
| Bucket              | ContainerName   | required    |
| Path prefix         |                 |             |
| Domain              | DomainName      |             |

- AccountName

    `AccountName` is your AccountName.

- AccountKey

    The `AccountKey` is your key to access Azure API.

:::note

You can obtain your account key from the Azure Portal under the "Access Keys" section on the left-hand pane of your storage account.

- (Optional) PrivateEndpoint

Azure Private Endpoint is a feature that allows connecting Azure services to Azure Virtual Network (VNet) private subnets. You can refer to the official Azure documentation for configuration: [private endpoint config](https://learn.microsoft.com/zh-cn/azure/private-link/tutorial-private-endpoint-storage-portal)

- ContainerName

In my example, Create a default container called 'default'.

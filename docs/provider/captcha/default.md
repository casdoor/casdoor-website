## Applied in application

Edit the application you want to configure in Casdoor. Select the provider just added. There are three kinds of rules:

- `Always` Always turned on human-machine verification when login.
- `None` Never require human-machine verification, the accout will be blocked when it attempted to login into the same application with wrong password for the 5st time within 15 minutes. And it will be unblocked after 15 minutes.
- `Dynamic` After 5 failed login attempts, the account will not be blocked but instead, human-machine verification will be required.

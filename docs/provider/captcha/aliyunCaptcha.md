Alibaba Cloud Captcha is a captcha service provided by Alibaba Cloud. It offers two ways to verify captcha: "Sliding Validation" and "Intelligent Validation". You can find more details about it in this [link](https://help.aliyun.com/product/28308.html).

Currently, only [Alibaba Cloud Captcha 1.0](https://help.aliyun.com/zh/captcha/captcha1-0) is supported. [Alibaba Cloud Captcha 2.0](https://help.aliyun.com/zh/captcha) is currently in the public testing phase, so there are no plans for adaptation in the near term.

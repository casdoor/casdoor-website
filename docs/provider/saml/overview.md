Casdoor can be configured to support user login to the UI using identities from external identity providers that support SAML 2.0. In this configuration, Casdoor never stores any credentials for the users.

Now, Casdoor supports multiple SAML application providers. Icons of the providers will be displayed on the login page after being added to Casdoor. Here are the providers that Casdoor supports:

## Terms

- Identity Provider (IDP) - The service that stores the identity database and provides identity and authentication services to Casdoor.
- Service Provider (SP) - The service that provides resources to the end user, in this case, the Casdoor deployment.
- Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) - The consumer of SAML assertions generated by the Identity Provider.

## Configuration Values for Casdoor as SP

When configuring an external Identity Provider (such as Google Workspace, Azure AD, or other SAML IdPs), you'll typically need to provide the following values:

- **ACS URL (Assertion Consumer Service URL)**: This is the endpoint where the IdP will send SAML assertions. For Casdoor, use: `https://<your-casdoor-domain>/api/acs` (replace `<your-casdoor-domain>` with your actual Casdoor domain, e.g., `https://door.example.com/api/acs`)

- **Entity ID (SP Entity ID)**: This uniquely identifies your Casdoor instance as a Service Provider. Use the same URL as the ACS URL: `https://<your-casdoor-domain>/api/acs`

- **Request Method**: The `/api/acs` endpoint only accepts POST requests. Ensure your IdP is configured to send SAML responses via HTTP POST binding.

## How SAML integration works

When using SAML SSO, users log into Casdoor via the identity provider without ever passing credentials to Casdoor. The progress is shown in the following diagram.

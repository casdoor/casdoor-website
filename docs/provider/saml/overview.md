Casdoor can be configured to support user login to the UI using identities from external identity providers that support SAML 2.0. In this configuration, Casdoor never stores any credentials for the users.

Now, Casdoor supports multiple SAML application providers. Icons of the providers will be displayed on the login page after being added to Casdoor. Here are the providers that Casdoor supports:

| Aliyun IDaaS | Keycloak | Custom |

## Terms

- Identity Provider (IDP) - The service that stores the identity database and provides identity and authentication services to Casdoor.
- Service Provider (SP) - The service that provides resources to the end user, in this case, the Casdoor deployment.
- Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) - The consumer of SAML assertions generated by the Identity Provider.

## How SAML integration works

When using SAML SSO, users log into Casdoor via the identity provider without ever passing credentials to Casdoor. The progress is shown in the following diagram.

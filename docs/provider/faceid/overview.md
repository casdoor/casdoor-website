Casdoor supports Face ID as a sign-in method. Only enable it when you can ensure the hardware and requests are trusted and not tampered with.

## Add a Face ID provider

1. Open the Casdoor admin UI → **Providers** → **Add**.
2. Set **Category** to **Face ID**.
3. Choose the **Type** (e.g. Alibaba Cloud FaceBody).
4. Fill in the required fields (e.g. **Client ID**, **Client Secret**, **Endpoint** as needed) and save.

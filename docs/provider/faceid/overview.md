Casdoor allows for the use of Face ID as a sign-in method.

We only recommend enabling Face ID if you can ensure that the hardware and requests cannot be tampered with.

## Adding an Face ID provider

1. Go to your Casdoor index page.
2. Click on `Providers` in the top bar.
3. Click on `Add`, and you will see a new provider added to the list at the top.
4. Click on the new provider to make changes to it.
5. In the `Category` section, select `Face ID`.
6. Choose the specific Face ID provider that you require from the `Type` dropdown.
7. Fill in the necessary information, such as `Client ID` and `Client Secret`.

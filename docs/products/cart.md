The shopping cart lets you collect products before purchasing them in a single order. Instead of buying items one at a time, add them to your cart and complete the transaction when you're ready.

## Adding Products to Cart

You'll find an "Add to cart" button on product pages and in the Product Store. When you add a product, it goes into your personal cart stored with your user account. The cart persists across sessions, so you can browse, add items, and come back later to complete your purchase.

Regular products can be added directly to the cart at their listed price. For recharge products, you'll need to specify the amount first—either by selecting a preset value or entering a custom amount. The system validates that custom amounts are greater than zero before adding them.

Subscription products work differently and don't support cart functionality. These must be purchased individually through their dedicated pricing and plan flow.

## Currency Consistency

All products in your cart must share the same currency. When adding a product with a different currency than existing cart items, the system prevents the addition and notifies you of the mismatch. This ensures the order total can be calculated accurately when you checkout.

## Managing Your Cart

Access your cart through the **Carts** menu option in the Business & Payments section. The cart page displays:

- Product name and display name
- Product image
- Price and currency
- Quantity (automatically managed by the system)

Each cart item shows a **Buy** button to purchase that product individually, or a **Delete** button to remove it from the cart. The system tracks quantities automatically—adding the same product at the same price increments the quantity counter rather than creating duplicate entries.

## Placing Orders from Cart

Currently, cart items are purchased individually. Click the "Buy" button next to a product to start the payment process for that item. The bulk "Place Order" functionality for purchasing all cart items together is under development.

When you successfully purchase an item, remove it from the cart manually or keep it for future reference. The cart provides a convenient way to track products you're interested in, even if you're not ready to buy them all at once.

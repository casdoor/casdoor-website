After the payment is successfully processed, you will be able to view the transaction information of the products in the **Payment** section. This information will include details such as the organization, user, purchase time, and product name.

When viewing a payment, you can navigate directly to the related order using the **View Order** button. After completing a payment, the system offers quick actions to either view the order details or return to the order list, streamlining your workflow.

The payment system automatically creates transactions linked to the user's signup application, ensuring accurate tracking across your organization's applications.

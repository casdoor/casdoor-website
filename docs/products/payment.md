After the payment is successfully processed, you will be able to view the transaction information of the products in the **Payment** section. This information will include details such as the organization, user, purchase time, and product name.

## Transactions and Balance Tracking

Casdoor automatically tracks balances for users and organizations through transactions. When transactions are created, updated, or deleted, the associated balances are automatically adjusted:

- **User transactions**: Update the user's balance and the organization's user balance sum
- **Organization transactions**: Update the organization's own balance

Transaction details can be viewed in the user edit page and organization edit page. Balances are also displayed in user and organization list pages.

## Invoice

To issue an invoice, navigate to the edit screen:

On the edit screen, you will need to fill in the relevant invoice information. There are two invoice types available: `individual` and `organization`.

To complete the process, simply click on the "**issue invoice**" button.

Please let us know if you have any further questions or concerns.

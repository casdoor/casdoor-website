You can add the product (or service) you want to sell. The following will tell you how to add a product.

## Configuring Products Attributes
First, you need to understand the basic properties of the product:
`Tag`
`Detail`
`Currency`
`Price`
`Quantity`
`Sold`

## Payment Provider
Of course, in addition to setting these properties, you also need to add payment providers to the product,
and multiple payment providers can be added to a product.

To learn how to configure a payment provider, see [Payment Provider](/docs/provider/payment/Alipay)

Finally, fill in the **Return URL**. This is the url to jump from the payment provider page when the payment
is completed.

You're done. See the review and save:

You can add the product (or service) you want to sell. The following will guide you through the process of adding a product.

## Configuring Product Attributes

First, you need to understand the basic properties of the product:

- Tag
- Detail
- Currency
- Price
- Quantity
- Sold

## Payment Provider

In addition to setting these properties, you also need to add payment providers to the product.
Multiple payment providers can be added to a product.

To learn how to configure a payment provider, refer to [Payment Provider](/docs/provider/payment/overview)

Finally, fill in the **Return URL**. This is the URL to which the payment provider page will redirect after the payment is completed.

### Success URL (Optional)

If you need the provider to redirect users directly to a custom URL instead of the Casdoor callback page, you can fill in the **Success URL** field. When configured, Casdoor will append the payment owner and transaction name as query parameters to your provided URL.

For example, if you set the Success URL to `http://example.com/payment/success`, users will be redirected to:

```text
http://example.com/payment/success?transactionOwner={paymentOwner}&transactionName={paymentName}
```

You can include additional query parameters in your Success URL, such as:

```text
http://example.com/payment/success?customParam=value&transactionOwner={paymentOwner}&transactionName={paymentName}
```

:::caution

**Important:** If you configure the Success URL field, you must manually call the `NotifyPayment` API to complete the transaction, otherwise the payment will fail.

Call the API endpoint: `api/notify-payment/{paymentOwner}/{paymentName}` using the parameters provided in the Success URL query string.

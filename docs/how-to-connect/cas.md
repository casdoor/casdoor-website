## Using Casdoor as a CAS Server

Casdoor can now be used as a CAS server. It currently supports CAS 3.0.

### Overview

The CAS endpoint prefix in Casdoor is `<Casdoor endpoint>/cas/<organization name>/<application name>`. Here is an example using the endpoint `https://door.casdoor.com` with an application named `cas-java-app` under the organization `casbin`:

- `/login` endpoint: `https://door.casdoor.com/cas/casbin/cas-java-app/login`
- `/logout` endpoint: `https://door.casdoor.com/cas/casbin/cas-java-app/logout`
- `/serviceValidate` endpoint: `https://door.casdoor.com/cas/casbin/cas-java-app/serviceValidate`
- `/proxyValidate` endpoint: `https://door.casdoor.com/cas/casbin/cas-java-app/proxyValidate`
- `/proxy` endpoint: `https://door.casdoor.com/cas/casbin/cas-java-app/proxy`
- `/validate` endpoint: `https://door.casdoor.com/cas/casbin/cas-java-app/validate`
- `/p3/serviceValidate` endpoint: `https://door.casdoor.com/cas/casbin/cas-java-app/p3/serviceValidate`
- `/p3/proxyValidate` endpoint: `https://door.casdoor.com/cas/casbin/cas-java-app/p3/proxyValidate`
- `/samlValidate` endpoint: `https://door.casdoor.com/cas/casbin/cas-java-app/samlValidate`

For more information about CAS, its different versions, and parameters for these endpoints, refer to the [CAS Protocol Specification](https://apereo.github.io/cas/7.1.x/protocol/CAS-Protocol-Specification.html).

### An Example

Here is an official example [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/apereo/cas-sample-java-webapp) that contains a web app and utilizes the official CAS Java client [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/apereo/java-cas-client). By going through this example, you can learn how to connect to Casdoor via CAS.

:::note

Note: Currently, Casdoor only supports all three versions of CAS: CAS 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0.

:::

The CAS configuration is located in `src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.yml`.

By default, this app uses CAS 3.0, which is specified by the following configurations:

```xml
<filter-name>CAS Validation Filter</filter-name>
<filter-class>org.jasig.cas.client.validation.Cas30ProxyReceivingTicketValidationFilter</filter-class>
```

If you want to protect this web app using CAS 2.0, change the CAS Validation Filter to the following:

```xml
<filter-name>CAS Validation Filter</filter-name>
<filter-class>org.jasig.cas.client.validation.Cas20ProxyReceivingTicketValidationFilter</filter-class>
```

For CAS 1.0, use the following:

```xml
<filter-name>CAS Validation Filter</filter-name>
<filter-class>org.jasig.cas.client.validation.Cas10TicketValidationFilter</filter-class>
```

For all instances of the `casServerUrlPrefix` parameter, change them to:

```xml
<param-name>casServerUrlPrefix</param-name>
<param-value>http://door.casdoor.com/cas/casbin/cas-java-app</param-value>
```

For all instances of the `casServerLoginUrl` parameter, change them to:

```xml
<param-name>casServerLoginUrl</param-name>
<param-value>http://door.casdoor.com/cas/casbin/cas-java-app/login</param-value>
```

If you need to customize more configurations, see the [Java CAS client GitHub Repository](https://github.com/apereo/java-cas-client) for detailed information.

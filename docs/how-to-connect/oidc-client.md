## OIDC discovery

Casdoor has fulfilled the OIDC protocol completely. If your application is already running against another OAuth 2.0 (OIDC) identity provider via a standard OIDC client library and you want to migrate to Casdoor, using OIDC discovery will be very easy for you to switch to Casdoor. Casdoor's OIDC discovery URL is:

```
<your-casdoor-backend-host>/.well-known/openid-configuration
```

E.g., the OIDC discovery URL for the demo site is: https://door.casdoor.com/.well-known/openid-configuration , with the following content:

```json

  "issuer": "https://door.casdoor.com",
  "authorization_endpoint": "https://door.casdoor.com/login/oauth/authorize",

  "userinfo_endpoint": "https://door.casdoor.com/api/userinfo",

## List of OIDC client libraries

Here we list a few OIDC client libraries for some languages like Go and Java:

| OIDC client library | Language | Link                                                   |
|---------------------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| go-oidc             | Go       | https://github.com/coreos/go-oidc                      |
| pac4j-oidc          | Java     | https://www.pac4j.org/docs/clients/openid-connect.html |

The above table is far from being complete. For a full list of OIDC client libraries, please see more details at:

## OIDC UserInfo fields

The following table shows how OIDC UserInfo fields (via `/api/userinfo` API) are mapped from properties of Casdoor's User table:

| Casdoor User Field | OIDC UserInfo Field |
|--------------------|---------------------|
| Id                 | sub                 |
| originBackend      | iss                 |
| Aud                | aud                 |
| Name               | preferred_username  |
| DisplayName        | name                |
| Email              | email               |
| Avatar             | picture             |
| Location           | address             |
| Phone              | phone               |

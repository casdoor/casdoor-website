## What is TOTP?

TOTP stands for Time-based One-Time Passwords and is a common form of two-factor authentication (2FA). Unique numeric passwords are generated with a standardized [algorithm](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238) that uses the current time as an input. These time-based passwords:

- Change every 30 seconds for enhanced security
- Are available offline
- Are widely supported by many services and apps
- Provide user-friendly, increased account security as a second factor

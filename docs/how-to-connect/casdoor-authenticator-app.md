## Overview

We are excited to introduce the Casdoor Authenticator App, a new addition to the Casdoor ecosystem that allows users to store TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) codes securely in Casdoor. With this app, users can conveniently manage their two-factor authentication (2FA) needs directly from their mobile devices. The Casdoor Authenticator App supports generating TOTP codes for enhanced security during login, providing a simple and user-friendly experience for securing your accounts.

In addition to client-side functionality, Casdoor also offers server-side management capabilities for administrators, enabling them to monitor and manage user logins and authentication processes more effectively. Furthermore, the Casdoor Authenticator App supports syncing TOTP data to the server, ensuring that your authentication codes are securely backed up and always available, providing a robust solution for managing your authentication needs.

Whether you are a developer, an administrator, or an end-user, the Casdoor Authenticator App ensures a seamless, secure, and flexible way to manage your two-factor authentication.

## What is TOTP?

TOTP stands for Time-based One-Time Passwords and is a common form of two-factor authentication (2FA). Unique numeric passwords are generated with a standardized [algorithm](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238) that uses the current time as an input. The time-based passwords are available offline and provide user-friendly, increased account security when used as a second factor.

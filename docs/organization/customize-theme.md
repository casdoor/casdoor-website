Themes control primary color and border radius so you can match your brand. Casdoor supports three levels:

| Level | Where to set | Applies to |
|-------|----------------|------------|
| **Global** | In Casdoor source only (no UI). | Any org that uses the global theme. |
| **Organization** | Organization edit page. | All Casdoor after-login pages for that org, and entry pages (sign-in, sign-up, forgot password, etc.) of applications that follow the org theme. |
| **Application** | Application edit page. | Entry pages of that application only. |

## Organization theme

Edit the organization and use the theme controls (primary color, border radius, etc.). Changes apply to that organization’s pages and to applications following the org theme.

:::info
If you are editing the same organization you are logged in as, changes apply immediately. Otherwise, sign in to that organization to see the updated theme.

## Application theme

Applications use the same theme editor. You can preview the theme in the application’s preview panel.

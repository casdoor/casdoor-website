## Add Multi-Factor Authentication Item in Organization

In the organization, admins can add Multi-Factor Authentication items to the account settings. This allows users to configure Multi-Factor Authentication on their own profile pages.

## Manage Multi-Factor Authentication Items

You can manage Multi-Factor Authentication to determine which methods are available to users.

There are two rules for managing Multi-Factor Authentication items:

- Optional: Users can choose whether to enable this type of Multi-Factor Authentication.
- Prompt: If the user does not enable this Multi-Factor Authentication mode, they will be prompted to enable it after logging in to Casdoor.
- Required: Users must enable this Multi-Factor Authentication method.

The image below shows the notification that prompts users to enable Multi-Factor Authentication.

This video demonstrates that when the Multi-Factor Authentication method is set to required, users need to enable Multi-Factor Authentication before they can complete the login process.

## Remember Multi-Factor Authentication

When logging in to Casdoor, users can choose to have the Multi-Factor Authentication for this account remembered for a specific period. This means they won't be prompted to perform Multi-Factor Authentication for the account again during that time.

You can set the duration for which Multi-Factor Authentication is remembered for an account in the organization settings. As shown, there is an "MFA remember time" option where you can specify the time (e.g., set it to 12 hours as in the example).

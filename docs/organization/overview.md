Organization is the basic unit for Casdoor, it manages users and applications. If a user signed in to an organization, then he can access all applications belong to the organization without signing in again.

In the config of [applications](/docs/applications/config) and [providers](/docs/provider/overview), choosing an organization is important, it determines whether a user can access the application using specific providers.

We can also set up LDAP in Casdoor, for more details, please see [LDAP](/docs/ldap/overview)

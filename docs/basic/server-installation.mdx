## Requirements

### Operating System

All major operating systems are supported, including Windows, Linux, and macOS.

### Environment

- [Go 1.21+](https://go.dev/dl/)
- [Node.js LTS (20)](https://nodejs.org)
- [Yarn 1.x](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

:::info

We strongly recommend using [Yarn 1.x](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) to run and build the Casdoor frontend. Using NPM might cause UI styling issues. For more details, see: [casdoor#294](https://github.com/casdoor/casdoor/issues/294).

:::

:::caution

If your network fails to directly sync Go dependency packages successfully, you need to use a Go proxy by configuring the GOPROXY environment variable. We strongly recommend using: <https://goproxy.cn/>

:::

### Database

Casdoor uses [XORM](https://xorm.io/) to communicate with the database. Based on [Xorm Drivers Support](https://xorm.io/docs/chapter-01/readme/), Casdoor currently provides support for the following databases:

- `MySQL`
- `MariaDB`
- `PostgreSQL`
- `CockroachDB`
- `SQL Server`
- `Oracle`
- `SQLite 3`
- `TiDB`

## Download

### Pre-built Binaries

Starting from recent releases, Casdoor provides pre-built binaries for all major platforms. This is the fastest way to get started if you don't need to modify the source code.

Download the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/casdoor/casdoor/releases). Each release includes binaries for:

- **Linux**: x86_64 and arm64 (`.tar.gz`)
- **macOS**: x86_64 and arm64 (`.tar.gz`)
- **Windows**: x86_64 and arm64 (`.zip`)

After downloading, extract the archive and run the `casdoor` executable. The binaries include the web frontend and a sample configuration file (`conf/app.conf`). You'll need to configure the database connection before running (see [Configure Database](#configure-database)).

Each pre-built binary contains version metadata that identifies the exact release and commit it was built from. You can query this information via the `/api/get-version-info` endpoint, which helps with troubleshooting and ensuring you're running the intended version in your deployment.

:::tip Quick Start with Binaries

```bash
# Linux/macOS example
tar -xzf casdoor_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz
cd casdoor_Linux_x86_64
# Edit conf/app.conf with your database settings
./casdoor
```

### Build from Source

The source code of Casdoor is hosted on GitHub: <https://github.com/casdoor/casdoor>. Both the Go backend code and React frontend code are contained in a single repository.

| Name     | Description                     | Language              | Source code                                          |
|----------|---------------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Frontend | Web frontend UI for Casdoor     | JavaScript + React    | <https://github.com/casdoor/casdoor/tree/master/web> |
| Backend  | RESTful API backend for Casdoor | Golang + Beego + XORM | <https://github.com/casdoor/casdoor>                 |

Casdoor supports `Go Modules`. To download the code, simply clone the code using git:

```shell
cd path/to/folder
git clone https://github.com/casdoor/casdoor
```

## Configuration

### Configure Database

Casdoor supports MySQL, MSSQL, SQLite3, and PostgreSQL. By default, Casdoor uses MySQL.

#### MySQL

Casdoor stores user, node, and topic information in a MySQL database named `casdoor`. If the database does not exist, it must be created manually. The DB connection string can be specified at: <https://github.com/casdoor/casdoor/blob/master/conf/app.conf>

```ini
driverName = mysql
dataSourceName = root:123456@tcp(localhost:3306)/
dbName = casdoor
```

#### PostgreSQL

Before running Casdoor, you need to manually prepare a database for PostgreSQL, as Casdoor requires a database to be selected when opening Postgres with xorm.

Assuming you have already prepared a database called `casdoor`, you should specify `app.conf` like this:

```ini
driverName = postgres
dataSourceName = user=postgres password=postgres host=localhost port=5432 sslmode=disable dbname=casdoor
dbName = casdoor
```

:::info
For PostgreSQL, ensure that `dataSourceName` has a non-empty `dbName` and also [duplicate](https://github.com/casdoor/casdoor/issues/2127) the database name for the `dbname` field as shown in the example above.
:::

#### CockroachDB

CockroachDB can also be used with the PostgreSQL driver and has the same configuration as PostgreSQL.

```ini
driverName = postgres
dataSourceName = user=postgres password=postgres host=localhost port=5432 sslmode=disable dbname=casdoor serial_normalization=virtual_sequence
dbName = casdoor
```

:::info
For CockroachDB, remember to add `serial_normalization=virtual_sequence` to the `dataSourceName` as shown in the example above. Otherwise, you will get an error regarding an existing database whenever the service starts or restarts. Note that this must be added before the database is created.
:::

#### SQLite3

To configure SQLite3, you should specify `app.conf` like this:

```ini
driverName = sqlite
dataSourceName = file:casdoor.db?cache=shared
dbName = casdoor
```

### Configuration Files

Casdoor can be configured via configuration files for both the backend and frontend. For a complete reference of all configuration options, see the [Configuration File](/docs/basic/configuration) documentation.

For basic setup, you typically only need to modify `driverName` and `dataSourceName` in the [**conf/app.conf**](https://github.com/casdoor/casdoor/blob/master/conf/app.conf) file based on your database (see [Configure Database](#configure-database)).

## Run

There are currently two methods to start, and you can choose one according to your situation.

### Development Mode

#### Backend

Casdoor's Go backend runs on port 8000 by default. You can start the Go backend with the following command:

```bash
go run main.go
```

After the server is successfully running, you can start the frontend part.

#### Frontend

Casdoor's frontend is a very classic [**Create-React-App (CRA)**](https://create-react-app.dev/) project. It runs on port `7001` by default. Use the following commands to run the frontend:

```bash
cd web
yarn install
yarn start
```

Visit [**http://localhost:7001**](http://localhost:7001) in your browser. Log into the Casdoor dashboard with the default global admin account: `built-in/admin`.

```bash
admin
123
```

### Production Mode

#### Backend

Build the Casdoor Go backend code into an executable and start it.

For Linux:

```bash
go build
./casdoor
```

For Windows:

```bash
go build
casdoor.exe
```

When building from source, version information is automatically embedded into the binary. The build process extracts git metadata (tag version, commit hash, and commit offset) and writes it to `util/variable.go`, making it available through the `/api/get-version-info` endpoint. This works even when the binary is distributed without the git repository, which is particularly useful for deployment scenarios and Docker containers.

#### Frontend

Build the Casdoor frontend code into static resources (.html, .js, .css files):

```bash
cd web
yarn install
yarn build
```

Visit [**http://localhost:8000**](http://localhost:8000) in your browser. Log into the Casdoor dashboard with the default global admin account: `built-in/admin`.

```bash
admin
123
```

:::tip

To use another port, please edit ```conf/app.conf``` and modify `httpport`, then restart the Go backend.

:::

:::info Casdoor Port Details

In the **dev** environment, the frontend is run by ```yarn run``` on port 7001, so if you want to go to the Casdoor login page, you need to set the Casdoor link as **<http://localhost:7001>**.

In the **prod** environment, the frontend files are first built by ```yarn build``` and served on port 8000, so if you want to go to the Casdoor login page, you need to set the Casdoor link as **<https://your-casdoor-url.com:8000>** (If you are using a reverse proxy, you need to set the link as **your domain**).

#### Take Our Official Forum Casnode as an Example

[Casnode](https://casnode.org) uses Casdoor to handle authentication.

When we are testing Casnode in the **dev** environment, we set the `serverUrl` as <http://localhost:7001>, so when we test the signin and signup functionality using Casdoor, it will go to localhost 7001, which is the Casdoor port.

And when we put Casnode into the **prod** environment, we set the `serverUrl` as <https://door.casdoor.com>, so users can sign in or sign up using Casdoor.

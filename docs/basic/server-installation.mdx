## Requirements

### OS

All major operating systems including Windows, Linux and macOS are supported.

### Environment

* [Go 1.6+](https://go.dev/dl/)
* [Node.js LTS (16 or 14)](https://nodejs.org)
* [Yarn 1.x](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

:::info

We strongly suggest you use [Yarn 1.x](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) to run & build Casdoor frontend, using NPM might cause UI styling issues, see more details at: [casdoor#294](https://github.com/casdoor/casdoor/issues/294)

:::

:::caution

For **Chinese** users, in order to download the Go dependency packages successfully, you need to use a Go proxy by Configuring the GOPROXY environment variable. We strongly recommend: https://goproxy.cn/

:::

### Database

Casdoor uses [XORM](https://xorm.io/) to talk to the database. Based on [Xorm Drivers Support](https://gitea.com/xorm/xorm#drivers-support), Casdoor currently provides support for following databases:

- `MySQL`
- `MariaDB`
- `PostgreSQL`
- `SQL Server`
- `Oracle`
- `SQLite 3`
- `TiDB`

## Download

The source code of Casdoor is hosted at GitHub: https://github.com/casdoor/casdoor. Both the Go backend code and React frontend code are inside the single repository.

Name | Description | Language | Source code
----|------|----|----
Frontend | Web frontend UI for Casdoor | JavaScript + React | https://github.com/casdoor/casdoor/tree/master/web
Backend | RESTful API backend for Casdoor | Golang + Beego + XORM | https://github.com/casdoor/casdoor

Casdoor supports `Go Modules`. To download the code, you can just simply clone the code via git:

```shell
cd path/to/folder
git clone https://github.com/casdoor/casdoor
```

## Configuration

### Configure Database

Casdoor supports mysql, mssql, sqlite3, postgres. Casdoor uses mysql by default. If you use another database, please
modify the import package in [object/adapter](https://github.com/casdoor/casdoor/blob/afa9c530adac39fdea329dbfd8a55775badb7d09/object/adapter.go#L24-L27).

#### MySQL:

  Casdoor will store its users, nodes and topics information in a MySQL database named: `casdoor`. If the database does not exist, it needs to be created manually. The DB connection string can be specified at: https://github.com/casdoor/casdoor/blob/master/conf/app.conf

  ```ini
  driverName = mysql
  dataSourceName = root:123456@tcp(localhost:3306)/
  dbName = casdoor
  ```

#### PostgreSQL:

  Since we must choose a database when opening Postgres with xorm, you should prepare a database manually before running Casdoor.

  Let's assume that you have already prepared a database called `casdoor`, then you should specify `app.conf` like this:

  ```ini
  driverName = postgres
  dataSourceName = "user=postgres password=postgres host=localhost port=5432 sslmode=disable dbname=casdoor"
  dbName =
  ```

:::info

For PostgreSQL, make sure `dataSourceName` has non-empty `dbName` and leave the standalone `dbName` field empty like the above example.

:::

#### Sqlite3

 First you should comment out the mysql package import and uncomment the **sqlite3** package import in `object/adapter.go`. Like this:

```go
	//_ "github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql" // db = mysql
	_ "github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3" // db = sqlite3
```

Then you should specify `app.conf` like this:

```ini
driverName = sqlite3
dataSourceName = "file:casdoor.db?cache=shared&mode=memory"
dbName =
```

### Via Ini file

Casdoor can be configured via a single file: [**conf/app.conf**](https://github.com/casdoor/casdoor/blob/master/conf/app.conf), the content of which by default is:

```ini
appname = casdoor
httpport = 8000
runmode = dev
SessionOn = true
copyrequestbody = true
driverName = mysql
dataSourceName = root:123456@tcp(localhost:3306)/
dbName = casdoor
tableNamePrefix =
showSql = false
redisEndpoint =
defaultStorageProvider =
isCloudIntranet = false
authState = "casdoor"
socks5Proxy = "127.0.0.1:10808"
verificationCodeTimeout = 10
initScore = 2000
logPostOnly = true
origin = "https://door.casdoor.com"
staticBaseUrl = "https://cdn.casbin.org"
```

  - `appname` is the application name, which currently has no practical use
  - `httpport` is the port that your back-end application is listening on
  - `runmode` is `dev` or `prod`
  - `SessionOn` decides whether to enable session,used by default.
  - `driverName`, `dataSourceName` and `dbName` are introduced before, please see [Configure Database](#configure-database).
  - `verificationCodeTimeout` set the expiration time of the verification code. After the expiration, the user needs to obtain it again

Despite all the configurable fields, as a beginner, you only need to modify two items: `driverName` and `dataSourceName` based on your database. This database will be used by Casdoor to store all data, including users, organizations, applications and so on.
  - `tableNamePrefix` is prefix of the table when using adapter.
  - `showSql` : show SQL statement or not on logger if log level is great than INFO.
  - `redisEndpoint` is the Redis endpoint used by Beego session storage. If this parameter is empty, the session data will be stored locally as files in `./tmp` folder. For using Redis as Beego session storage, an example for this value would be: `redis.example.com:6379`. If Redis password is enabled, use `redis.example.com:6379,db,password`. See more details at: https://beego.vip/docs/module/session.md#saving-provider-config
  - `defaultStorageProvider` is the default file storage service name. If you need to use file storage services such as avatar upload, you need to set up a storage provider and apply it in your application. See [**storage**](/docs/provider/storage/overview) for details.
  - `isCloudIntranet` is used to identify whether your provider endpoint is intranet endpoint.
  - `authState` is the authorization application name. This parameter will be checked when logging in.
  - `socks5Proxy` is the SOCKS proxy server IP address. **Set the proxy port**, because we have google-related services or use `Google` `GitHub` `Facebook` `LinkedIn` `Steam` as OAuth Provider which will be restricted by the network in some areas.
  - `initScore` is the initial score of each user. Each user has a score attribute. Score is used by [**Casnode**](https://github.com/casbin/casnode). Score does not control anything in Casdoor.
  - `logPostOnly` is used to identify whether only use post method to add a record.
  - `origin` is the origin backend domain name.
  - `staticBaseUrl` is address of the static image when the system initializes the database.

### Via Environment Variables

**All configuration items defined by Casdoor** in the ini file mentioned above can be chosen to configuration via environmental variables, so can **some of the beego configurations** items(httpport,appname).

For example, when you try to start casdoor, you can use something like this to pass the configuration via environmental variables.
```shell
appname=casbin go run main.go
```
Besides, `export` derivatives are also a possible method. The names of environmental variables should be exactly the same with the names you want to use in the ini file.

*Note: configurations in environmental variables can **override** the configurations in ini file*.


## Run

There are currently two methods to start, you can choose one according to your own situation.

### Development mode

#### Backend

Casdoor's Go backend runs at port 8000 by default. You can start the Go backend with the following command:

```bash
go run main.go
```

After the server is successfully running, we can start the frontend part.

#### Frontend

Casdoor's frontend is a very classic [**Create-React-App (CRA)**](https://create-react-app.dev/) project. It runs at port `7001` by default. Use the following commands to run the frontend:

```bash
cd web
yarn install
yarn start
```

Visit: [**http://localhost:7001**](http://localhost:7001) in your browser. Log into Casdoor dashboard with the default global admin account: `built-in/admin`

```bash
admin
123
```

### Production mode

#### Backend

Build Casdoor Go backend code into executable and start it.

For Linux:

```bash
go build
./casdoor
```

For Windows:

```bash
go build
casdoor.exe
```

#### Frontend

Build Casdoor frontend code into static resources (.html, .js, .css files):

```bash
cd web
yarn install
yarn build
```

Visit: [**http://localhost:8000**](http://localhost:8000) in your browser. Log into Casdoor dashboard with the default global admin account: `built-in/admin`

```bash
admin
123
```

:::tip

To use another port, please edit ```conf/app.conf``` and modify `httpport`, then restart the Go backend.

:::

:::info casdoor port details

In **dev** environment, the frontend is run by ```yarn run``` in port 7001, so if you want to go to Casdoor login page, you need set Casdoor link as **http://localhost:7001**.

In **prod** environment, the frontend files is first built by ```yarn build``` and served in port 8000, so if you want to go to Casdoor login page, you need to set Casdoor link as **http://SERVER_IP:8000** (If you are using reverse proxy, you need to set the link as **your domain**).

#### Take our official forum Casnode as an example:

[Casnode](https://casnode.org) uses Casdoor to handle authentication.

When we are testing Casnode in **dev** environment, we set the `serverUrl` as http://localhost:7001, so when we test signin and signup functionality using Casdoor, it will go to localhost 7001 which is the Casdoor port.

And when we put Casnode to **prod** environment, we set the `serverUrl` as https://door.casdoor.com, so users can signin or signup using Casdoor.

## Requirements

### Operating System

All major operating systems are supported, including Windows, Linux, and macOS.

### Environment

- [Go 1.21+](https://go.dev/dl/)
- [Node.js LTS (20)](https://nodejs.org)
- [Yarn 1.x](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

:::info

We strongly recommend using [Yarn 1.x](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) to run and build the Casdoor frontend. Using NPM might cause UI styling issues. For more details, see: [casdoor#294](https://github.com/casdoor/casdoor/issues/294).

:::

:::caution

If your network fails to directly sync Go dependency packages successfully, you need to use a Go proxy by configuring the GOPROXY environment variable. We strongly recommend using: <https://goproxy.cn/>

:::

### Database

Casdoor uses [XORM](https://xorm.io/) to communicate with the database. Based on [Xorm Drivers Support](https://xorm.io/docs/chapter-01/readme/), Casdoor currently provides support for the following databases:

- `MySQL`
- `MariaDB`
- `PostgreSQL`
- `CockroachDB`
- `SQL Server`
- `Oracle`
- `SQLite 3`
- `TiDB`

## Download

The source code of Casdoor is hosted on GitHub: <https://github.com/casdoor/casdoor>. Both the Go backend code and React frontend code are contained in a single repository.

| Frontend | Web frontend UI for Casdoor     | JavaScript + React    | <https://github.com/casdoor/casdoor/tree/master/web> |
| Backend  | RESTful API backend for Casdoor | Golang + Beego + XORM | <https://github.com/casdoor/casdoor>                 |

Casdoor supports `Go Modules`. To download the code, simply clone the code using git:

```shell
cd path/to/folder
git clone https://github.com/casdoor/casdoor
```

## Configuration

### Configure Database

Casdoor supports MySQL, MSSQL, SQLite3, and PostgreSQL. By default, Casdoor uses MySQL.

For detailed database configuration and all available configuration options, please see the [Configuration File](/docs/basic/configuration-file) documentation.

#### Quick Start Example

For a quick start with MySQL, configure your `conf/app.conf`:

```ini
driverName = mysql
dataSourceName = root:123456@tcp(localhost:3306)/
dbName = casdoor
```

:::info

For complete configuration reference including all backend options (`app.conf`) and frontend options (`Conf.js`), see [Configuration File](/docs/basic/configuration-file).

## Run

There are currently two methods to start, and you can choose one according to your situation.

### Development Mode

#### Backend

Casdoor's Go backend runs on port 8000 by default. You can start the Go backend with the following command:

```bash
go run main.go
```

After the server is successfully running, you can start the frontend part.

#### Frontend

Casdoor's frontend is a very classic [**Create-React-App (CRA)**](https://create-react-app.dev/) project. It runs on port `7001` by default. Use the following commands to run the frontend:

```bash
cd web
yarn install
yarn start
```

Visit [**http://localhost:7001**](http://localhost:7001) in your browser. Log into the Casdoor dashboard with the default global admin account: `built-in/admin`.

```bash
admin
123
```

### Production Mode

#### Backend

Build the Casdoor Go backend code into an executable and start it.

For Linux:

```bash
go build
./casdoor
```

For Windows:

```bash
go build
casdoor.exe
```

#### Frontend

Build the Casdoor frontend code into static resources (.html, .js, .css files):

```bash
cd web
yarn install
yarn build
```

Visit [**http://localhost:8000**](http://localhost:8000) in your browser. Log into the Casdoor dashboard with the default global admin account: `built-in/admin`.

```bash
admin
123
```

:::tip

To use another port, please edit ```conf/app.conf``` and modify `httpport`, then restart the Go backend.

:::info Casdoor Port Details

In the **dev** environment, the frontend is run by ```yarn run``` on port 7001, so if you want to go to the Casdoor login page, you need to set the Casdoor link as **<http://localhost:7001>**.

In the **prod** environment, the frontend files are first built by ```yarn build``` and served on port 8000, so if you want to go to the Casdoor login page, you need to set the Casdoor link as **<https://your-casdoor-url.com:8000>** (If you are using a reverse proxy, you need to set the link as **your domain**).

#### Take Our Official Forum Casnode as an Example

[Casnode](https://casnode.org) uses Casdoor to handle authentication.

When we are testing Casnode in the **dev** environment, we set the `serverUrl` as <http://localhost:7001>, so when we test the signin and signup functionality using Casdoor, it will go to localhost 7001, which is the Casdoor port.

And when we put Casnode into the **prod** environment, we set the `serverUrl` as <https://door.casdoor.com>, so users can sign in or sign up using Casdoor.

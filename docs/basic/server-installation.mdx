## Requirements

### Operating System

All major operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and macOS, are supported.

### Environment

- [Go 1.17+](https://go.dev/dl/)
- [Node.js LTS (18)](https://nodejs.org)
- [Yarn 1.x](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

:::info

We strongly suggest using [Yarn 1.x](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) to run and build Casdoor frontend. Using NPM might cause UI styling issues. For more details, see: [casdoor#294](https://github.com/casdoor/casdoor/issues/294).

:::

:::caution

If your network fails to directly sync the Go dependency packages successfully, you need to use a Go proxy by configuring the GOPROXY environment variable. We strongly recommend using: <https://goproxy.cn/>

### Database

Casdoor uses [XORM](https://xorm.io/) to communicate with the database. Based on [Xorm Drivers Support](https://gitea.com/xorm/xorm#drivers-support), Casdoor currently provides support for the following databases:

- `MySQL`
- `MariaDB`
- `PostgreSQL`
- `CockroachDB`
- `SQL Server`
- `Oracle`
- `SQLite 3`
- `TiDB`

## Download

The source code of Casdoor is hosted on GitHub: <https://github.com/casdoor/casdoor>. Both the Go backend code and React frontend code are contained in a single repository.

Name | Description | Language | Source code
----|------|----|----
Frontend | Web frontend UI for Casdoor | JavaScript + React | <https://github.com/casdoor/casdoor/tree/master/web>
Backend | RESTful API backend for Casdoor | Golang + Beego + XORM | <https://github.com/casdoor/casdoor>

Casdoor supports `Go Modules`. To download the code, simply clone the code using git:

```shell
cd path/to/folder
git clone https://github.com/casdoor/casdoor
```

## Configuration

### Configure Database

Casdoor supports MySQL, MSSQL, SQLite3, and PostgreSQL. By default, Casdoor uses MySQL.

#### MySQL

Casdoor stores user, node, and topic information in a MySQL database named `casdoor`. If the database does not exist, it must be created manually. The DB connection string can be specified at: <https://github.com/casdoor/casdoor/blob/master/conf/app.conf>

```ini
driverName = mysql
dataSourceName = root:123456@tcp(localhost:3306)/
dbName = casdoor
```

#### PostgreSQL

Before running Casdoor, you need to manually prepare a database for PostgreSQL, as Casdoor requires selecting a database when opening Postgres with xorm.

Assuming you have already prepared a database called `casdoor`, you should specify `app.conf` like this:

```ini
driverName = postgres
dataSourceName = user=postgres password=postgres host=localhost port=5432 sslmode=disable dbname=casdoor
dbName = casdoor
```

:::info
For PostgreSQL, ensure that `dataSourceName` has a non-empty `dbName` and also [duplicate](https://github.com/casdoor/casdoor/issues/2127) the database name for the `dbname` field as shown in the example above.
:::

#### CockroachDB

CockroachDB can also be used with the PostgreSQL driver and has the same configuration as PostgreSQL.

```ini
driverName = postgres
dataSourceName = user=postgres password=postgres host=localhost port=5432 sslmode=disable dbname=casdoor serial_normalization=virtual_sequence
dbName = casdoor
```

:::info
For CockroachDB, remember to add `serial_normalization=virtual_sequence` to the `dataSourceName` as shown in the example above. Otherwise, you will get an error regarding an existing database whenever the service starts or restarts. Note that this must be added before the database is created.
:::

#### SQLite3

To configure SQLite3, you should specify `app.conf` like this:

```ini
driverName = sqlite
dataSourceName = file:casdoor.db?cache=shared
dbName = casdoor
```

### Via Ini file

Casdoor can be configured via a single file: [**conf/app.conf**](https://github.com/casdoor/casdoor/blob/master/conf/app.conf), which by default contains the following content:

```ini
appname = casdoor
httpport = 8000
runmode = dev
SessionOn = true
copyrequestbody = true
driverName = mysql
dataSourceName = root:123456@tcp(localhost:3306)/
dbName = casdoor
tableNamePrefix =
showSql = false
redisEndpoint =
defaultStorageProvider =
isCloudIntranet = false
authState = "casdoor"
socks5Proxy = "127.0.0.1:10808"
verificationCodeTimeout = 10
initScore = 2000
logPostOnly = true
origin = "https://door.casdoor.com"
staticBaseUrl = "https://cdn.casbin.org"
enableGzip = true
inactiveTimeoutMinutes =
```

- `appname` is the application name, which currently has no practical use.
- `httpport` is the port that your backend application is listening on.
- `runmode` can be set to `dev` or `prod`.
- `SessionOn` determines whether to enable session and is enabled by default.
- `driverName`, `dataSourceName`, and `dbName` were introduced earlier. Please see [Configure Database](#configure-database) for details.
- `verificationCodeTimeout` sets the expiration time of the verification code. After expiration, the user needs to obtain it again.

As a beginner, you only need to modify two items: `driverName` and `dataSourceName` based on your database. This database will be used by Casdoor to store all data, including users, organizations, and applications.

- `tableNamePrefix` is the prefix of the table when using an adapter.
- `showSql` determines whether to show SQL statements on the logger if the log level is greater than INFO.
- `redisEndpoint` is the Redis endpoint used by Beego session storage. If this parameter is empty, the session data will be stored locally as files in the `./tmp` folder. To use Redis as Beego session storage, the value would be something like: `redis.example.com:6379`. If Redis is deployed locally, you can use `localhost:6379`. If Redis password is enabled, use `redis.example.com:6379,db,password`. See more details at: <https://github.com/beego/beedoc/blob/master/en-US/module/session.md#saving-provider-config>.
- `defaultStorageProvider` is the default file storage service name. If you need to use file storage services such as avatar upload, you need to set up a storage provider and apply it in your application. See [**storage**](/docs/provider/storage/overview) for details.
- `isCloudIntranet` is used to identify whether your provider endpoint is an intranet endpoint.
- `authState` is the authorization application name. This parameter will be checked when logging in.
- `socks5Proxy` is the SOCKS proxy server IP address. Set the proxy port because we have Google-related services or use `Google`, `GitHub`, `Facebook`, `LinkedIn`, or `Steam` as OAuth Providers, which may be restricted by the network in some areas.
- `initScore` is the initial score of each user. Each user has a score attribute. The score is used by [**Casnode**](https://github.com/casbin/casnode) and does not control anything in Casdoor.
- `logPostOnly` is used to determine whether only the post method is used to add a record.
- `origin` is the origin backend domain name.
- `staticBaseUrl` is the address of the static image used when the system initializes the database.
- `enableGzip` will accept and respond with gzip encoding if the request header includes `Accept-Encoding=gzip`.
- `inactiveTimeoutMinutes` sets the maximum number of minutes of inactivity. If the inactivity time reaches this value, then casdoor will log the user out. Empty value or value less than or equal to 0 means there is no limit on the user's inactivity time.

### Via Environment Variables

All configuration items defined by Casdoor in the ini file mentioned above can be configured via environment variables, as well as some of the beego configurations items (httpport, appname).

For example, when you try to start Casdoor, you can use something like this to pass the configuration via environment variables:

```shell
appname=casbin go run main.go
```

In addition, `export` derivatives are also a possible method. The names of environmental variables should exactly match the names you want to use in the ini file.

Note: configurations in environmental variables can override the configurations in the ini file.

## Run

There are currently two methods to start, and you can choose one according to your situation.

### Development Mode

#### Backend

Casdoor's Go backend runs on port 8000 by default. You can start the Go backend with the following command:

```bash
go run main.go
```

After the server is successfully running, you can start the frontend part.

#### Frontend

Casdoor's frontend is a very classic [**Create-React-App (CRA)**](https://create-react-app.dev/) project. It runs on port `7001` by default. Use the following commands to run the frontend:

```bash
cd web
yarn install
yarn start
```

Visit [**http://localhost:7001**](http://localhost:7001) in your browser. Log into the Casdoor dashboard with the default global admin account: `built-in/admin`.

```bash
admin
123
```

### Production Mode

#### Backend

Build the Casdoor Go backend code into an executable and start it.

For Linux:

```bash
go build
./casdoor
```

For Windows:

```bash
go build
casdoor.exe
```

#### Frontend

Build the Casdoor frontend code into static resources (.html, .js, .css files):

```bash
cd web
yarn install
yarn build
```

Visit [**http://localhost:8000**](http://localhost:8000) in your browser. Log into the Casdoor dashboard with the default global admin account: `built-in/admin`.

```bash
admin
123
```

:::tip

To use another port, please edit ```conf/app.conf``` and modify `httpport`, then restart the Go backend.

:::info Casdoor Port Details

In the **dev** environment, the frontend is run by ```yarn run``` on port 7001, so if you want to go to the Casdoor login page, you need to set the Casdoor link as **<http://localhost:7001>**.

In the **prod** environment, the frontend files are first built by ```yarn build``` and served on port 8000, so if you want to go to the Casdoor login page, you need to set the Casdoor link as **<https://your-casdoor-url.com:8000>** (If you are using a reverse proxy, you need to set the link as **your domain**).

#### Take Our Official Forum Casnode as an Example

[Casnode](https://casnode.org) uses Casdoor to handle authentication.

When we are testing Casnode in the **dev** environment, we set the `serverUrl` as <http://localhost:7001>, so when we test the signin and signup functionality using Casdoor, it will go to localhost 7001, which is the Casdoor port.

And when we put Casnode into the **prod** environment, we set the `serverUrl` as <https://door.casdoor.com>, so users can sign in or sign up using Casdoor.

title: Basic Concept Introduction
---

This chapter is a brief introduction to concepts in Casdoor. Details of these concepts can be found in next chapters.

## Organization

An organization is a set of users and applications. 

Organizations are basic units for a SSO platform. If a user signed in to an organization, then he can access all applications of the organization without signing in again.

## Application

If you want to use Casdoor to provide login service for your web Web APPs, you can add them as Casdoor applications.

Users can access all applications in their organizations without login twice.

## Provider

Providers are used to provide services for Casdoor. Now, you can add OAuth providers, Email API providers, SMS API providers. We are going to integrate more providers in Casdoor in future.

## User

As an authentication platform, Casdoor is able to manage users.

## Token

Casdoor is based on OAuth. Tokens are users' OAuth token.

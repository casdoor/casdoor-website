title: Casdoor Public API
---

Casdoor is developed in a frontend and backend separated manner (in contrast to JSP or PHP). The Go backend only exposes its functionality via RESTful API. The React frontend code consumes the RESTful API to render the web UI and perform actions. We call the RESTful API as `Casdoor Public API`. The API can usually be used by:

- Casdoor's frontend
- Casdoor client SDKs
- Any other customized code from the application side

The full reference of `Casdoor Public API` can be viewed at Swagger: [**https://door.casdoor.com/swagger**](https://door.casdoor.com/swagger) . This Swagger docs are automatically generated by Beego's Bee tool.

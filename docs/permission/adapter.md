Casdoor supports using the UI to connect the adapter and manager the policy rules. In Casbin, the policy storage is implemented
as an adapter (aka middleware for Casbin). A Casbin user can use an adapter to load policy rules from a storage, or save
policy rules to it.

## Adapter

- `type` : Adapter type. Now support database adapter.
- `Host`
- `Port`
- `User`
- `Password`
- `Database type` : Now support Mysql, postgreSQL, SQL server, Oracle, Sqlite 3.
- `Database` : The database name.
- `Table` : The table name. If the table is not exist, it will be created.
- `model` : You can select one model belong to the organization of the adapter.

## Basic CURD

If you connect the adapter successfully, you can make basic CURD to the policy rules.

- Add

  ![adapter_add](/img/permission/adapter/add.gif)

:::tip

You can only add one policy in one time. New added policy is in the first row in the table, but actually it will
be saved at the last row. So next time you sync the policies, it will appear in the last row of the table.

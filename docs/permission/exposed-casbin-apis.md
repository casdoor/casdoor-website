## Introduction

Let's assume that your application front-end has obtained the `access_token` of the logged-in user, and now wants to authenticate the user for some access. You cannot simply place the `access_token` to the HTTP request header to use these APIs, because Casdoor uses the `Authorization` field to check the access permission. Like any other APIs provided by Casdoor, the `Authorization` field consists of the application client id and secret, using the [Basic HTTP Authentication Scheme](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7617). It looks like `Basic XXX`. For this reason, Casbin APIs should be called by the application backend server. Here are steps about how to do it. 

1. The front end passes the `access_token` to the backend server through the HTTP request header. 
2. The backend server gets the user id from the `access_token` which is also parameter `v0`  in APIs described below. 

As a note in advance, these interfaces are also pretty much designed (for now) for the `(sub, obj, act)` model. The `id` in the interface is the identity of the applied permission policy, which consists of the organization name and the permission policy name (ie `organization name/permission name`). `v0`, `v1` and `v2` in turn correspond to the policy structure described by the permission model, usually representing `sub`, `obj` and `act` respectively. 

In addition to the API interface for requesting enforcement of permission control, Casdoor also provides other interfaces that help external applications obtain permission policy information, which is also listed here. 

### Enforce

Request: 

```shell
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:8000/api/enforce' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Basic client_id_and_secret' \
--data-raw '{"id":"example-org/example-permission", "v0":"example-org/example-user", "v1":"example-resource", "v2":"example-action"}'
```

Response:

```
true
```

### BatchEnforce

Request:

```shell
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:8000/api/batch-enforce' \

--data-raw '[{"id":"example-org/example-permission", "v0":"example-org/example-user1", "v1":"example-resource", "v2":"example-action"}, {"id":"example-org/example-permission", "v0":"example-org/example-user2", "v1":"example-resource", "v2":"example-action"}, {"id":"example-org/example-permission", "v0":"example-org/example-user3", "v1":"example-resource", "v2":"example-action"}]'

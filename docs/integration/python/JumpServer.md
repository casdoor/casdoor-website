[Casdoor](/docs/basic/server-installation) can use CAS to connect [JumpServer](https://github.com/jumpserver/jumpserver/).

The following are some of the names in the configuration:

`CASDOOR_HOSTNAME`: Domain name or IP where Casdoor server is deployed.

`JumpServer_HOSTNAME`: Domain name or IP where JumpServer is deployed.

## Step1. Deploy Casdoor and JumpServer

Firstly, the [Casdoor](/docs/basic/server-installation) and [JumpServer](https://github.com/jumpserver/jumpserver/) should be deployed.

After a successful deployment, you need to ensure:

1. Casdoor can be logged in and used normally.
2. You can set CASDOOR_HOSTNAME = `http://localhost:8000`. When deploy Casdoor in `prod` mode. See [production mode](https://casdoor.org/docs/basic/server-installation#production-mode).

## Step2. Configure Casdoor application

1. Create or use an existing Casdoor application.
2. Find a redirect url: `CASDOOR_HOSTNAME`/cas/`your orgnazition`/`your application`/login
3. Add your redirect url to casdoor application: `JumpServer_HOSTNAME`

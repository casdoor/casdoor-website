[shardingsphere-elasticjob-ui](https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere-elasticjob-ui) have integrated Casdoor. We can use it after config it.

## Step1. Deploy Casdoor

Firstly, the Casdoor should be deployed.

You can refer to the Casdoor official documentation for the [Server Installation](/docs/basic/server-installation).

After a successful deployment, you need to ensure:

- The Casdoor server is successfully running on **http://localhost:8000**.
- Open your favorite browser and visit **http://localhost:7001**, you will see the login page of Casdoor.
- Input `admin` and `123` to test login functionality is working fine.

Then you can quickly implement a casdoor based login page in your own app with the following steps.

## Step2. Configure Casdoor application and configure application in ShardingSphere

1.**Create or use an existing Casdoor application**

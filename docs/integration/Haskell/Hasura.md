Before the integration, we need to deploy Casdoor locally.

Then we can quickly implement a Casdoor-based login page in our own app with the following steps.

## Configure Casdoor application

1. Create or use an existing Casdoor application.
2. Add a redirect URL: `http://CASDOOR_HOSTNAME/login`

3. Copy the client ID; we will need it in the following steps.

## Add a user in Casdoor

Now that you have the application, but not a user. That means you need to create a user and assign the role.

Go to the "Users" page and click on "Add user" in the top right corner. That opens a new page where you can add the new user.

Save the user after adding a username and adding the organization Hasura (other details are optional).

Now you need to set up a password for your user, which you can do by clicking "manage your password."

Choose a password for your user and confirm it.

## Build the Hasura App

Start the Hasura by Docker or Hasura Cloud.

Now create a `users` table with the following columns:

* `id` of type Text (Primary Key)
* `username` of type Text

Refer to the image below for reference.

The next step is to create a `user` role for the app. Users should be able to see only their records but not other people's records.

Configure the `user` role as shown in the image below. For more information, read about [configuring permission rules in Hasura](https://hasura.io/docs/2.0/auth/authorization/permissions/).

![Picture showing how to set permissions in Hasura](https://graphql-engine-cdn.hasura.io/learn-hasura/assets/graphql-hasura-authentication/keycloak/hasura-set-permissions.png)

This way, users cannot read other people's records. They can only access theirs.

For testing purposes, add a dummy user. This is to ensure that when you use the JWT token, you only see your user's details and not other users' details.

Now you need to set the `JWT_SECRET` in Hasura.

## Configure Hasura with Casdoor

In this step, you need to add the **HASURA_GRAPHQL_JWT_SECRET** to Hasura.

To do so, go to the Hasura docker-compose.yaml and then add the new `HASURA_GRAPHQL_JWT_SECRET` as below.

The `HASURA_GRAPHQL_JWT_SECRET` should be in the following format. Remember to change `<Casdoor endpoint>` to your own Casdoor's URL (like `https://door.casdoor.com`)

```yaml
HASURA_GRAPHQL_JWT_SECRET: '{"claims_map": {
      "x-hasura-allowed-roles": {"path": "$.roles"},
      "x-hasura-default-role": {"path": "$.roles[0]"},
      "x-hasura-user-id": {"path": "$.id"}
    },"jwk_url":"<Casdoor endpoint>/.well-known/jwks"}'
```

Save the change and reload the docker.

## Retrieve the JWT Token

Since there is no client implementation, you can get your access token by making a request by the below URL:

```url
http://localhost:8000/login/oauth/authorize?client_id=<client ID>&response_type=code&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A8080%2Flogin&scope=read&state=app-built-in<public certificate>>
```

Change `client ID` to the ID you copied before and input the public certificate of Casdoor, which you can find in Casdoor's Certs page.

Then input the username and password you created for Hasura before.

Click "Sign in"

![Retrieve the JWT Token](/img/integration/Haskell/Hasura/login.png)

Go back to the Casdoor/Token page.

![Token Page](/img/integration/Haskell/Hasura/tokens.png)

Find the Username you input before, then click "edit"

Copy the Access Token

![Access Token](/img/integration/Haskell/Hasura/access.png)

Now you can use the access token to make the authenticated request. Hasura returned the appropriate user rather than returning all the users from the database.

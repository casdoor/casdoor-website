[Casdoor](/docs/basic/server-installation) can use Oauth to connect [Moodle](https://github.com/moodle/moodle).

The following are some of the names in the configuration:

`CASDOOR_HOSTNAME`: Domain name or IP where Casdoor server is deployed.

`Moodle_HOSTNAME`: Domain name or IP where Moodle is deployed.

## Step1. Deploy Casdoor and Moodle

Firstly, the [Casdoor](/docs/basic/server-installation) and [Moodle](https://github.com/moodle/moodle) should be deployed.

After a successful deployment, you need to ensure:

1. Casdoor can be logged in and used normally.
2. You can set CASDOOR_HOSTNAME = `http://localhost:8000`. When deploy Casdoor in `prod` mode. See [production mode](https://casdoor.org/docs/basic/server-installation#production-mode).

## Step2. Configure Casdoor application

1. Create or use an existing Casdoor application.
2. Find a redirect url: `Moddle_HOSTNAME`/admin/oauth2callback.php
3. Add your redirect url to casdoor application

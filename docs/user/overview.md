## User Properties

As an authentication platform, Casdoor is able to manage users. Every user has the following properties:

- `Owner`: The organization that owns the user
- `Name`: The unique username
- `CreatedTime`
- `UpdatedTime`
- `Id`: Unique identifier for each user
- `Type`
- `Password`
- `PasswordSalt`
- `PasswordOptions`: Password complexity options
- `DisplayName`: Displayed in the user interface
- `FirstName`
- `LastName`
- `Avatar`: A link to the user's avatar
- `PermanentAvatar`
- `Email`
- `Phone`
- `Location`
- `Address`
- `Affiliation`
- `Title`
- `IdCardType`
- `IdCard`
- `Homepage`
- `Bio`
- `Tag`
- `Region`
- `Language`
- `Gender`
- `Birthday`
- `Education`
- `Score`
- `Karma`
- `Ranking`
- `IsDefaultAvatar`
- `IsOnline`
- `IsAdmin`: Indicates whether the user is an admin of their organization
- `IsGlobalAdmin`: Indicates whether the user has permission to manage the Casdoor
- `IsForbidden`
- `IsDeleted`: When a user is soft-deleted (`IsDeleted = true`), they cannot sign in through any authentication method, including OAuth providers. This prevents deleted users from re-registering via third-party login.
- `SignupApplication`
- `Hash`
- `PreHash`
- `CreatedIp`
- `LastSigninTime`
- `LastSigninIp`
- `Roles`: An array of the user's roles (extended field, read-only via User API)
- `Permissions`: An array of the user's permissions (extended field, read-only via User API)

Unique IDs for social platform logins:

- `Github`
- `Google`
- `QQ`
- `WeChat`
- `Facebook`
- `DingTalk`
- `Weibo`
- `Gitee`
- `LinkedIn`
- `Wecom`
- `Lark`
- `Gitlab`
- `Adfs`
- `Baidu`
- `Casdoor`
- `Infoflow`
- `Apple`
- `Azure AD`
- `Azure AD B2C`
- `Slack`
- `Steam`
- `Ldap`

## Understanding Roles and Permissions Fields

The `Roles` and `Permissions` fields in the User object are **extended fields** that are dynamically populated when retrieving user data. These fields are not stored directly in the User table but are collected from the Roles and Permissions resources through the `ExtendUserWithRolesAndPermissions()` function.

**Important:** You cannot update roles and permissions through the `/api/update-user` endpoint, even when using the `columns` parameter. To manage user roles and permissions, you must use the dedicated APIs for Roles and Permissions resources.

To assign roles or permissions to users:

- **Roles**: Use the Roles API endpoints to create and assign roles. Visit the Roles management page (e.g., `https://door.casdoor.com/roles`) or use the [roles API](/docs/user/roles#managing-roles-via-api).
- **Permissions**: Use the Permissions API endpoints to create and assign permissions. Visit the Permissions management page (e.g., `https://door.casdoor.com/permissions`) or use the [permissions API](/docs/user/permissions#managing-permissions-via-api).

## Using the Properties Field

The `Properties` field is a flexible key-value map (`map[string]string`) that allows you to store custom attributes for users beyond the predefined fields in the User schema. This is particularly useful when you need to:

- Store organization-specific user attributes
- Add custom metadata that doesn't fit into standard fields
- Extend user profiles without modifying the core schema

## Importing Users from XLSX File

You can add new users or update existing Casdoor users by uploading an XLSX file containing user information.

In the Admin Console, go to Users and click the **Upload (.xlsx)** button.

Select your XLSX file and click Open. The users will be imported.

We provide a [template XLSX file](https://github.com/casdoor/casdoor/blob/master/xlsx/user_test.xlsx) named `user_test.xlsx` in the `xlsx` folder. The template includes 5 test users and headers for some required user properties.

## Bypass password encryption

When migrating users from an external database to Casdoor, there might be situations where you want to bypass or control the default encryption method provided by `organization` default Password type method.

This can be achieved by using the `passwordType` field during user import.

:::note User with Bycrypt password

Below is an example of a POST body request for the API route `/api/add-user`.

```json
{
  "owner": "organization",
    "signupApplication": "first-app",
    "email":"dev@dev.com",
    "name": "dev",
    "displayName": "developper",
    "password": "$2a$10$.o/iVyDE9Xk8ioywHDnQRu72RviOi6FPa1ujhusbSCZeg7VOa6MY6",
    "passwordType":"bcrypt",
}
```

Here, the user's password is already encrypted using the bcrypt algorithm, so we specify the `passwordType` as "bcrypt" to inform Casdoor not to encrypt it again.

## Importing Users from XLSX File

You can add new users or update existing Casdoor users by uploading an XLSX file containing user information.

In the Admin Console, go to Users and click the **Upload (.xlsx)** button.

![Importing Users](/img/user/import_users.png)

Select your XLSX file and click Open. The users will be imported.

We provide a [template XLSX file](https://github.com/casdoor/casdoor/blob/master/xlsx/user_test.xlsx) named `user_test.xlsx` in the `xlsx` folder. The template includes 5 test users and headers for some required user properties.

## Bypass password encryption

When migrating users from an external database to Casdoor, there might be situations where you want to bypass or control the default encryption method provided by `organization` default Password type method.

This can be achieved by using the `passwordType` field during user import.

:::note User with Bycrypt password

Below is an example of a POST body request for the API route `/api/add-user`.

```json
{
  "owner": "organization",
    "signupApplication": "first-app",
    "email":"dev@dev.com",
    "name": "dev",
    "displayName": "developper",
    "password": "$2a$10$.o/iVyDE9Xk8ioywHDnQRu72RviOi6FPa1ujhusbSCZeg7VOa6MY6",
    "passwordType":"bcrypt",
}
```

Here, the user's password is already encrypted using the bcrypt algorithm, so we specify the `passwordType` as "bcrypt" to inform Casdoor not to encrypt it again.

**Forms** let admins customize how list pages for core entities (users, providers, etc.) are displayed: which columns appear, their order, labels, and widths.

## Overview

The Forms entry page lists all existing forms. Select a **Form type** (e.g. User list, Provider list) to edit the layout for that entity’s list page.

## Form items

- **Edit items** — Change **Label** (e.g. "User ID" → "Employee ID"), **Width**, and **Visible** (show/hide column).
- **Remove items** — Delete columns you don’t need.
- **Reorder** — Use "Move Up" / "Move Down" to set column order.

## Preview

The preview matches the live list page so you can confirm column order, labels, widths, and visibility before saving.

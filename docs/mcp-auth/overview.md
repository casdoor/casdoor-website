The Model Context Protocol (MCP) specification requires servers to implement OAuth 2.1 for secure authentication. Building a compliant authorization server from scratch—with Dynamic Client Registration, PKCE, consent screens, JWKS endpoints, and token issuance—is a significant engineering burden for developers who just want to build MCP tools.

**Casdoor solves this problem.** As a full-featured, open-source identity platform, Casdoor provides all the OAuth 2.1 infrastructure your MCP server needs. Point your server's Protected Resource Metadata to Casdoor, and it handles user authentication, consent, token issuance, and validation—while you focus on building your MCP tools.

## Why use Casdoor for MCP auth?

The MCP spec separates the authorization server from the resource server. While this separation allows MCP servers to delegate authentication to external providers, it also requires implementing:

- **OAuth 2.1 endpoints**: Authorization, token, and introspection endpoints
- **Dynamic Client Registration (DCR)**: RFC 7591 for automatic client registration
- **PKCE**: Proof Key for Code Exchange for secure authorization flows
- **Consent screens**: User-facing UI for granting permissions
- **Token validation**: JWKS endpoints and JWT signature verification
- **Resource indicators**: RFC 8707 for audience-restricted tokens
- **Metadata discovery**: RFC 8414 and OIDC Discovery for endpoint advertising

Building and maintaining this yourself is a large effort. Casdoor provides it out of the box.

## Using Casdoor as the MCP auth provider

Instead of building your own authorization server, configure your MCP server to use Casdoor as its OAuth provider. Casdoor provides:

    Client->>Casdoor: 5. OAuth metadata discovery
    Client->>Casdoor: 6. Dynamic Client Registration (DCR)
    Client->>Casdoor: 7. Authorization code flow + PKCE
    Casdoor->>Client: 8. Access token (JWT, aud=mcp-server)
    Client->>Server: 9. Tool calls with Bearer token
    Server->>Casdoor: 10. Validate token via JWKS endpoint
    Server->>Server: 11. Check aud claim & enforce scopes
    Server->>Client: 12. Tool responses
```

### What Casdoor Provides

Casdoor implements the complete OAuth 2.1 stack required for MCP authorization:

**Standards Compliance**:

- ✅ [RFC 8414](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8414): OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata (`/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`)
- ✅ [OIDC Discovery](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html): OpenID Connect Discovery (`/.well-known/openid-configuration`)
- ✅ [RFC 7591](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7591): Dynamic Client Registration (`/api/oauth/register`)
- ✅ [RFC 7636](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7636): PKCE support in authorization flow
- ✅ [RFC 8707](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8707): Resource Indicators (audience-restricted tokens)
- ✅ [RFC 7517](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7517): JWKS endpoint for token validation

**Built-in Features**:

- 🔐 **User authentication**: Password, SSO, MFA, WebAuthn, Face ID
- 👤 **User management**: Organizations, roles, permissions, user directory
- ✅ **Consent screens**: Customizable authorization prompts with scope descriptions
- 🎟️ **Token management**: JWT issuance, refresh tokens, token introspection
- 🔑 **Custom scopes**: Define granular permissions for your MCP tools (see [Custom Scopes](../application/scopes.md))
- 🏢 **Multi-tenancy**: Organization-based isolation for different deployments
- 📊 **Audit logs**: Track authorization events and token usage

**Developer Experience**:

- 🌐 **Self-hosted**: Deploy on your infrastructure, maintain full control
- 💻 **Open source**: Apache 2.0 license, inspect and modify the code
- 🚀 **Production-ready**: Used by thousands of organizations worldwide
- 📚 **Extensive SDKs**: Go, Python, Node.js, Java, and more

### What Your MCP Server Needs to Do

Your MCP server's responsibilities are minimal:

1. **Serve Protected Resource Metadata**: Return a JSON document at `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` pointing to Casdoor
2. **Return 401 challenges**: Send `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer` headers on unauthorized requests
3. **Validate JWT tokens**: Use Casdoor's JWKS endpoint to verify token signatures
4. **Check audience**: Ensure the token's `aud` claim matches your server's resource URI
5. **Enforce scopes**: Verify the token contains required scopes for each tool

That's it. No user database, no password hashing, no session management, no OAuth endpoint implementation.

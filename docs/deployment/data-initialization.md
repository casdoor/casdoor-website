If you are deploying Casdoor with other services as a whole application, you may want to provide an **out-of-box** feature for users (User can directly use the application without any configuration). 

For such a situation, you can use data initialization to register your service in Casdoor through one configuration file. This file can be pre-defined or dynamically generated by your owner service.

## How to use

If there is one configuration file named as `init_data.json` at the root directory of Casdoor, it will be used to initialize data in Casdoor. **What you should do is just to put this file at the root directory where Casdoor will run.**

If you use official docker image of Casdoor, the following are some scripts that can help you to mount `init_data.json` into the container.

### Docker
If you deploy Casdoor with docker, you can use the `volume` to mount `init_data.json` into the container.

```bash
docker run ... -v /path/to/init_data.json:/init_data.json
```

### Kubernetes
If you deploy Casdoor with kubernetes, you can use the `configmap` to store `init_data.json`.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: casdoor-init-data
data:
  init_data.json:
```

You can mount the data into Casdoor `pods` by mounting the `configmap`. You may modify your `deployment` as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
...
spec:
  template:
    ...
    spec:
      containers:
      ...
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /init_data.json
          name: casdoor-init-data-volume
          subPath: init_data.json
      volumes:
      - configMap:
          name: casdoor-init-data
        name: casdoor-init-data-volume
```



## File details

There is already a template named `init_data.json.template` at the root directory of Casdoor repository. You can refer to this file to customize your initialization.

The following is the Go struct of each part mapping to and their documentation:

If you still feel confused of filling this template, you can call restful api or use the debug mode of your browser to see the response of `GetXXX` to these objects. These response are in the same format as `init_data.json`.

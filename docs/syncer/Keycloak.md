The **Keycloak syncer** extends the [database syncer](/docs/syncer/Database) with preset configuration for Keycloak’s schema, so you can migrate users from Keycloak to Casdoor without manual column mapping.

User data in Keycloak is spread across several tables (`credential`, `keycloak_group`, `user_group_membership`, etc.). The syncer reads from these tables and maps them into Casdoor users.

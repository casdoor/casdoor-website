Casdoor is built on OAuth and utilizes tokens as users' OAuth tokens.

The following are the available token fields in Casdoor:

- `Owner`
- `Name`
- `CreatedTime`
- `Application`
- `Organization`
- `User`
- `Code`
- `AccessToken`
- `ExpireIn` (Tokens will expire in hours)
- `Scope` (Scope of authorization)
- `TokenType` (e.g., `Bearer` type)

After logging into the application, there are three options to generate a JWT Token:

- `JWT`
- `JWT-Empty`
- `JWT-Custom`
- `JWT-Standard`

The options are as follows: JWT will generate a token containing all User fields, JWT-Empty will generate a token with all non-empty values for the user, and JWT-Custom will generate a token containing custom User Token fields (you can choose attributes in the Token fields). JWT-Standard will generate a token with some standard OIDC token fields include email, phone, gender and Address (Address value in other format is not standard).

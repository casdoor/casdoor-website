You can upload resources in casdoor. Before upload resources, you need to configure a storage provider.
Please see [Storage Provider](/docs/provider/storage/storage)

You have now configured at least one **storage provider** and added that provider to your **application**

**This is an example of how to upload and delete resources**

### upload resources
Users can upload resources such as files and images to the previously configured [cloud storage](/docs/provider/storage/storage).

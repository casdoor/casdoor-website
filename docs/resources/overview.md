You can upload resources in casdoor. Before upload resources, you need to configure a storage provider.
Please see [Storage Provider](/docs/provider/storage)

You have now configured at least one **storage provider** and added that provider to your **application**.

### Upload Resources

Users can upload resources such as files and images to the previously configured [cloud storage](/docs/provider/storage).

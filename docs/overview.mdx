## What is Casdoor?

Casdoor is a modern, UI-first [Identity Access Management (IAM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_management) and [Single-Sign-On (SSO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on) platform that makes authentication and user management simple and secure. Whether you're building a small app or managing enterprise-scale authentication, Casdoor provides everything you need in one elegant package.

## How Casdoor Works

![Authentication Flow](/img/principles.gif)

Understanding how Casdoor works is easier than you might think! At its core, Casdoor implements the OAuth 2.0 authorization flow, which might sound complex but is actually quite intuitive. Let's walk through it step by step.

### Before We Begin

Casdoor uses the OAuth 2.0 protocol for authorization. If you're new to OAuth, don't worry - we'll explain everything you need to know. For a deeper dive, check out this excellent [introduction to OAuth 2.0](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-oauth-2).

### The Authentication Dance: A Step-by-Step Story

Think of OAuth as a conversation between three parties: your application, Casdoor (the authentication server), and your user. Here's how they work together:

#### Step 1: Your App Asks for Permission

Your application needs to access user resources, so it creates a special URL that looks like this:

```url
https://your-casdoor-url.com/login/oauth/authorize?
  client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID
  &response_type=code
  &redirect_uri=https://yourapp.com/callback
  &scope=read
  &state=YOUR_APP_NAME
```

:::note Quick Reference

**Where do I find these values?**

- **`client_id`**: Found in your Application settings in Casdoor
- **`redirect_uri`**: Your application's callback URL where users return after logging in
- **`state`**: Your application name (helps prevent CSRF attacks)

:::

Your app essentially tells the user: *"I need access to some of your information. Please go to this URL and log in so I can get permission."*

#### Step 2: User Grants Permission

The user clicks the link and lands on Casdoor's login page. After entering their credentials, Casdoor verifies their identity and sends back two important pieces of information to your app's callback URL:

- **`code`**: A temporary authorization code
- **`state`**: The application identifier (for security verification)

Casdoor is saying: *"I recognize this user! Here's a special code proving they gave your app permission. Use it wisely!"*

:::tip Social Login Option

Users can also log in using third-party providers like Google or GitHub. Instead of entering credentials, they'll see a list of login options. Casdoor acts as the middleman, making social login integration a breeze.

:::

#### Step 3: Exchanging the Code for an Access Token

Now your application has the authorization code. It makes a server-to-server request to Casdoor saying: *"Hey, I have this code from a user. Can you verify it and give me an access token?"*

#### Step 4: Casdoor Issues the Access Token

Casdoor validates the code and responds: *"This code checks out! Here's your access token. Use it to access the user's information."*

This access token is like a temporary key that proves your app has been authorized to access specific user resources.

#### Step 5: Accessing Protected Resources

With the fresh access token in hand, your application can now request user data from Casdoor's resource server (or any other resource server that trusts Casdoor).

Your app says: *"I have this access token from Casdoor. Can I please access the user's profile information?"*

#### Step 6: Getting the Data

The resource server validates the token and responds: *"Token verified! Here's the user data you requested."*

And that's it! Your application now has the user information it needs, and the user has securely authenticated without you having to build complex authentication systems.

:::note Casdoor's Dual Role

Casdoor acts as both an **Authorization Server** (handling the login and token issuance) and a **Resource Server** (storing and providing user information). This means you get a complete authentication solution in one package!

## Architecture

Casdoor is built with a modern, scalable architecture that separates concerns for maximum flexibility:

| Component | Description | Technology Stack | Source Code |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|-------------|
| **Frontend** | Beautiful, responsive web UI for managing users, apps, and settings | JavaScript + React | [View Code](https://github.com/casdoor/casdoor/tree/master/web) |
| **Backend** | Powerful RESTful API handling authentication, authorization, and data management | Golang + Beego + SQL | [View Code](https://github.com/casdoor/casdoor) |

This separation means you can scale each component independently, customize the frontend without touching the API, or integrate Casdoor's backend into your own UI.
